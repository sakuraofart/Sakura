            <h5 class="jma__subtitle">Creating a website for an architectural firm like Jessica Mille Architecte
                involves several key stages and addresses various technical and creative challenges. Here's how the
                studio might have approached this project:</h5>
            <div class="jma-image"><img src="../images/portfolio-images/jma4.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="jma-text__block">
                <div class="jma-text__title">Requirements Analysis and Preparation</div>
                <ul>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Client Discussion:</span> The first step was to communicate
                        with the Jessica
                        Mille Architecte team to understand their brand, work style, target audience, and website
                        functionality requirements. It was crucial to identify what features needed to be reflected on
                        the site, such as project portfolios, a blog, contact information, etc.</li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Market Research:</span> Analyzing competitors and current
                        trends in
                        architectural website design helped determine best practices and unique approaches that could be
                        used.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="jma-image"><img src="../images/portfolio-images/jma2.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="jma-text__block">
                <div class="jma-text__title">Concept and Prototype Development</div>
                <ul>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Creating Wireframes and Mockups:</span> At this stage, draft
                        layouts of the pages (wireframes) were developed to determine content placement, navigation, and
                        user pathways. Then, high-fidelity mockups were created, taking into account branding and visual
                        style.</li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>UI/UX Design:</span> Given the need to emphasize the unique
                        style of the architectural firm, particular attention was paid to a minimalist and modern
                        design, with a focus on visual elements such as project images, photographs, and galleries.
                    </li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Client Design Approval:</span> After presenting the mockups to
                        the client and receiving their feedback, the design was refined and approved.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="jma-image"><img src="../images/portfolio-images/jma1.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="jma-text__block">
                <div class="jma-text__title">Development and Programming</div>
                <ul>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Frontend Development:</span> The main task for frontend
                        developers was to convert the approved mockups into interactive and responsive web pages.
                        Special attention was paid to optimizing images and website loading speed.</li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Backend Development:</span> Depending on the chosen platform,
                        the developers set up a content management system (CMS) for easy future updates. Functional
                        modules like project galleries, a blog, and contact forms were also implemented.
                    </li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Testing:</span> At this stage, the team conducted thorough
                        testing of all site functions on various devices and browsers. This included checking for
                        errors, ensuring proper display, and testing the site’s performance in real-world conditions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="jma-image"><img src="../images/portfolio-images/jma3.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="jma-text__block">
                <div class="jma-text__title">Launch and Support</div>
                <ul>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Website Launch:</span> After final testing, the site was
                        deployed on the client's server or recommended hosting. Additional optimization was performed to
                        improve performance and SEO.</li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Client Training:</span> The studio provided instructions and,
                        if necessary, conducted training for the client’s team on managing the site, adding new content,
                        and using the CMS.
                    </li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Technical Support and Maintenance:</span> The studio continued
                        to support the site, including regular system updates, performance monitoring, and adding new
                        features as needed.
