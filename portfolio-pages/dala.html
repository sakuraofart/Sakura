            <h1 class="jma__title">Dala Technologies Limited</h1>
            <h5 class="jma__subtitle">Creating a website like Dala involved a comprehensive process that balanced
                creative vision with technical precision. Here's how the studio might have approached the project:</h5>
            <div class="jma-image"><img src="../images/portfolio-images/jma4.png" alt=""></div>
            <div class="jma-text__block">
                <div class="jma-text__title">Initial Consultation and Research</div>
                <ul>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Client Briefing:</span> The process began with detailed
                        discussions with the Dala team to understand their brand identity, objectives, target audience,
                        and the specific functionalities they needed for the site. Understanding the brand’s
                        aesthetic—modern, minimalistic, and design-focused—was crucial in guiding the project.</li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Market and Competitor Analysis:</span> We conducted thorough
                        research on industry trends and competitor websites to identify key elements that would help
                        Dala stand out while maintaining a user-friendly experience.

            <div class="jma-text__block">
                <div class="jma-text__title">Conceptualization and Design</div>
                <ul>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Wireframing and Prototyping:</span> Based on the initial
                        research and client input, we created wireframes to outline the website’s structure, ensuring a
                        seamless flow of information and intuitive navigation. The focus was on creating a clean,
                        visually engaging layout that reflects Dala’s design ethos.</li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Visual Design:</span> The design phase was centered around
                        translating Dala’s brand identity into a digital format. This involved choosing a restrained
                        color palette, elegant typography, and a layout that emphasizes whitespace and clean lines.
                        Special attention was given to the visual hierarchy to guide users naturally through the
                        content.
                    </li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Client Feedback and Iteration:</span> After presenting the
                        initial designs, we worked closely with the Dala team to refine the aesthetics and functionality
                        based on their feedback, ensuring the final design aligned perfectly with their vision.

                <div class="jma-text__title">Development</div>
                <ul>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Frontend Development:</span> The next step was bringing the
                        design to life through responsive frontend development. The challenge was to ensure the site
                        looked and performed well across all devices, maintaining its minimalistic beauty without
                        compromising on functionality. Advanced CSS techniques were employed to create smooth animations
                        and transitions that enhance the user experience.</li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Backend Development:</span> We implemented a custom content
                        management system (CMS) that allows the Dala team to easily update content without needing
                        technical expertise. The CMS was designed to be intuitive and flexible, supporting the website’s
                        sleek design while ensuring efficient content management.
                    </li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Integration of Features:</span> Key features like a dynamic
                        portfolio section, interactive elements, and seamless transitions were integrated to showcase
                        Dala’s projects effectively. Ensuring that the site loads quickly and runs smoothly, even with
                        high-resolution images and animations, was a top priority.
                    </li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Cross-Platform Testing:</span> Any issues identified during
                        testing were addressed promptly, and additional optimization was performed to improve site speed
                        and performance. This included image compression, code minification, and leveraging browser
                        caching.

                <ul>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Maintaining Performance with High-Quality Visuals:</span> One
                        of the main challenges was balancing the high-quality visuals required by Dala’s brand with the
                        need for fast loading times. We tackled this by using modern image formats, implementing lazy
                        loading, and optimizing the website's assets.</li>
                    <li class="jma-text__subtitle"><span>Ensuring a Seamless User Experience:</span> Given Dala’s focus
                        on design, it was crucial that the website provided a seamless, intuitive user experience. This
                        was achieved through careful planning of user pathways, a well-structured information
                        architecture, and a strong focus on usability testing.
